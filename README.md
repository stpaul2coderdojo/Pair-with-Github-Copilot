I would like a Python script that can take in a mathematical equation and solve it symbolically while providing step-by-step solutions. Furthermore, the script should take the results of each step and provide the LaTeX syntax.

A good idea of what I want to do can be found at the following website: https://www.sympygamma.com/input/?i=x**2-5

See example "diff(x**2 - 5, x)"
