I would like a Python script that can take in a mathematical equation and solve it symbolically while providing step-by-step solutions. Furthermore, the script should take the results of each step and provide the LaTeX syntax.

A good idea of what I want to do can be found at the following website: https://www.sympygamma.com/input/?i=x**2-5

See example "diff(x**2 - 5, x)"

Hello:

Looking to expand a current app by adding a signup/login using firebase token based authentication, food barcode scanner, a history screen (can save scanner/camera results to history). Existing python program will be connected to app to process food data from camera and barcode.


I have designs and all needed codes that will need to be combined and updated to create final app.

Finished upload finished app to AppStore and Playstore.

Bot needed to refresh page and click link 
https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/details/~01d00db2f9370249b0?q=python&user_location_match=1&t=1&amount=0-99,100-499&from_recent_search=true&sort=recency&pageTitle=Job%20Detail&_navType=slider&_modalInfo=%5B%7B%22navType%22%3A%22slider%22,%22title%22%3A%22Job%20Detail%22,%22modalId%22%3A%221655490719004%22%7D%5D
I'm in need of a simple python or similar language bot that will click a specified element on a webpage after refreshing the page at a given time interval. If possible, I'd also like to vary the time interval between page refreshes or be able to set a random time interval between a given maximum and minimum.

For example, I'd like to refresh a page every 10 seconds and when the specified element is found, I want the bot to click on it instantly. After a delay of a second or two, I'd like the bot to resume page refreshes every 10 seconds. No GUI is necessary as I am familiar with editing scripts so I can change the values for time intervals between refreshes for instance to suit my needs
